# Installing and running Wordpress:
To host a Wordpress website, use this folder structure on the server. The `docker-compose.yml` file should be adjusted to the specific website accordingly. Configure `VIRTUAL_HOST` and `container_name`, plus the database and Wordpress related variables.

### Note
The CI/CD for Gitlab has not been setup yet for Wordpress websites. Please check the other folders for inspiration in case you wish to do so.
